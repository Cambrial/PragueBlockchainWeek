    In the past 30 days, Loanscan has tracked 1618 loans issued on the Ethereum blockchain — that's 1618 people who were able to tap into a line of uncensorable digital credit from literally anywhere in the world.
    Back in May 2017, stablecoins were a theoretical construct hardly seen in the wild. There are now not only live stablecoins, but a rapidly growing diversity of them (70!)— and they're working!
    There are over 1.2 million NFTs listed on OpenSea — this asset class, mind you, hardly **EXISTED** before December of 2017.
